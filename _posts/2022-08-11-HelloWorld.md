# Hello, World

My name is Marvie, and I'm making the obligatory `Hello, World` first post. 
I've been a QA Engineer for quite sometime, spending a fair share of testing desktop software 
and webapps. My testing experience is solid, varied and extensive. But I'm a manual tester. Yes, a _manual tester_. How I lasted this long without 
automation in my toolkit is a story for another time. I'm not a big fan of putting myself out there, but what the heck - I'm doing it!

This is me stepping out of my comfort zone. I'm writing because I'm planning to do something, _ballsy_.
I'm [CPACC certified] (https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional), and lately been thinking hard to take it to the next level.
Thanks to my awesome dev friends at work, I have a good grasp and enough exposure on semantic HTML, CSS, and WAI-ARIA. And although I don't have
formal hands-on front-end coding experience, I am cooking up a plan to review for [WAS (Web Accessiblity Specialist)] (https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/s/certified-professional-web-accessibility), eventually take the exam, 
and see if I can pass it. Ballsy, indeed.

I believe that if you put your mind and heart in to something, and if you are willing to do the hardwork, there's nothing you can't achieve. 
But I'm also a realist, so this thing really intimidates the ðŸ’© out of me. All I know is that this journey is gonna be interesting.
It will be a win-win for me either way. If I fail, who cares? I still gained knowledge.

I am feeling positive about this. And hope I can keep my motivation going. Cheers!
